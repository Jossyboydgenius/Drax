# DeGen: Bridging Mobile Banking & DeFi

## Overview

Mobile money and Web3 banking are widely used, but many users fall victim to scams (false transaction notifications, account draining, stolen account information). This becomes problematic as users can't easily distinguish fake transactions from real ones, making it difficult to protect themselves. At the same time, jumping into Web3 is complex, fragmented, and intimidating for the average user. There's no smooth path from mobile banking to DeFi yield.

Mobile money and Web3 banking are widely used, but many users fall victim to scams (false transaction notifications, account draining, stolen account information). This becomes problematic as users can't easily distinguish fake transactions from real ones, making it difficult to protect themselves. At the same time, jumping into Web3 is complex, fragmented, and intimidating for the average user. There’s no smooth path from mobile banking to DeFi yield.

**DeGen** is a platform that bridges traditional mobile banking with decentralized finance (DeFi). It uses real-time transaction analysis, fraud detection, and Web3 integrations to help users understand, protect, and grow their money.

## Key Features

### Mobile Money to Web3 Bridge
Users can convert their mobile banking or mobile money assets directly within the platform through our integration with **Bybit**, allowing them to seamlessly purchase **USDT** without leaving the app.

### Secure Transaction Verification
- **Real-time verification** of mobile money transactions
- **QR code scanning** for merchant and agent validation
- **iExec confidential computing** for private data protection

### DeFi Integrations
Once they've acquired USDT, users can:

- **Cross-Chain Finance**: Participate in cross-chain lending and token swaps, accessing liquidity and earning yield across multiple blockchains
- **Conditional Voting**: Join Conditional Voting, where users vote on shared investment strategies and earn more yield (or take collective risk) depending on success
- **GameFi**: Play in a fully on-chain Blackjack game, competing head-to-head with other users using USDT, with the winner taking the full pot

### Community Features
- Conditional voting communities
- Gaming communities
- AI-powered announcements and insights for voters
- Private groups for specialized activities (staking, voting, gaming)

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js** - React framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Shadcn UI** - Modern UI components
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS
- **XMTP** - Secure messaging protocol

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity** - Smart contract language
- **Foundry** - Development framework for testing and deployment
- **Chainlink** - Oracles and automation
- **OpenZeppelin** - Contract security libraries

### Blockchain Networks
- **Base** - Primary deployment network
- **Cross-chain functionality** via CCIP (Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)

## Architecture

DeGen consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend Application**: Next.js-based web interface for user interactions
2. **Mobile Verifier DApp**: Solidity smart contracts handling blockchain interactions

The architecture is designed to be:
- **Modular**: Components can be upgraded independently
- **Secure**: Utilizing confidential computing and secure verification
- **Scalable**: Supporting multiple chains and transaction types
- **User-friendly**: Simplifying complex Web3 interactions

## User Journey

1. **Connect**: Link mobile money accounts for transaction monitoring
2. **Verify**: Validate transactions, agents, and merchants for security
3. **Convert**: Exchange mobile money to USDT seamlessly
4. **Explore**: Discover DeFi opportunities, communities, and games
5. **Earn**: Generate yield through lending, voting, and gaming

## Project Components
